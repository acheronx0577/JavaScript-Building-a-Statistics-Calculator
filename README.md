## 📈 Statistical Measures Calculated

| Measure | Description | Formula |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Mean** | Average value | Sum of all values ÷ Count |
| **Median** | Middle value | Central value when sorted |
| **Mode** | Most frequent | Value(s) with highest frequency |
| **Range** | Data spread | Maximum - Minimum |
| **Variance** | Data dispersion | Average of squared differences from mean |
| **Standard Deviation** | Spread measurement | Square root of variance |
